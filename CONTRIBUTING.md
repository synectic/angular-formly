An example will get you help faster than anything else you do. Create an example by going to
[help.angular-formly.com](http://help.angular-formly.com)

Please post questions to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) using the
[angular-formly](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/angular-formly/info) tag. There's also the
[mailing list](https://groups.io/org/groupsio/formly-js) where you can ask/answer questions. Also join us on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/formly-js/angular-formly).

If you file an issue with a question, it will be closed. I'm not trying to be mean. I'm just trying to stay sane. :-)

If you would like to add functionality, please submit [an issue](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues)
first to make sure it's a direction we want to take.

Please do the following:
* Follow the existing styles (we have an `.editorconfig` file)
* Document your changes in the README (try to follow the convention you see in the rest of the file)
* Create an example for the website that demonstrates your changes so people can see how your changes work

### Development

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start` (if you're on a windows machine, see [this issue](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/305))
3. write tests & code in ES6 goodness :-)
4. commit your changes to the `src/` directory only please. Also, please keep PRs changing only what the specific issue is addressing. In your commit message, add a reference to the issue it's addressing (i.e. Fixes issue with templateManipulators #153)
5. notice that there's a pre-commit hook that runs to ensure tests pass and coverage doesn't drop to prevent the build from breaking :-)
6. push your changes
7. create a PR with a link to the original issue
8. wait patiently :-)

#### Notes

- Please don't commit any changes to the `dist/` directory. This is only committed for releases.
- Due to some inconsistencies with angular versions, always use `require('angular-fix')` rather than simply `require('angular')`
- If you wish to view your changes visually, you can play around with it in the `local-examples` directory. Don't commit anything in this directory, but it's a good sanity check. It's just straight JavaScript with an `index.html`. I recommend `http-server`.
